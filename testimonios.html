        <h2>Everything you need is<br>already in your story</h2>
        <p>I've lived this myself, through each decade I've walked through, and so have the women I work with. There comes a point where you know something isn't feeling right… not because you're lost, but because you want something to change and you're not sure what that looks like yet.</p>
        
        <p>You might be questioning the direction you're heading in. You might feel like you're outgrowing parts of your life. Or you might just want to feel more like you again – whatever decade you're in.</p>
        
        <p>More women feel this than you'd ever expect.</p>
        
        <p>And this is where the real work begins. This is about the future, taking the thread in your story, the strength, knowledge and skills you already carry, and bringing them into your life today so you can move forward with fresh eyes, real confidence and the strength to handle whatever comes next.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Let's figure it out together.</strong></p>

                    <h2>Your story is telling you it's time.</h2>
                    <div class="pink-accent"></div>
                    <p>You've been through changes, and they've made you see yourself differently. You're noticing new thoughts, new feelings and a quiet sense that something in you is ready – you're just not sure what that looks like yet.</p>
                    <p><strong>That's where I come in.</strong></p>

    <!-- Quote Section -->
    <section class="quote-section">
        <p>"I felt completely lost questioning my purpose, direction, and who I was. Lisa's honesty, openness, and vulnerability made it easy to open up. Working with her gave me the confidence to set up my own business, something I never would have believed I could do. She helped me trust myself, make clearer decisions, and prioritise my own self-care. A truly impactful experience."</p>

    <!-- Story Section -->
    <section class="section">
        <div class="two-columns">
            <div>
                <h2>your story is calling</h2>
                <div class="pink-accent"></div>
                <p>Women usually come to me when things finally click when they know they want more direction, more confidence and someone in their corner to help them move forward. It's that moment where you think, I'm ready for this now. Not a big overhaul. Just a clearer path and support that makes sense.</p>
                
                <p>My work is straightforward – real conversations, real stories, real belief.</p>
                
                <p>A space to talk honestly about your life, your work and your relationships so we can figure out what you want next.</p>
                
                <p>This isn't about quick fixes. It's about joining the dots in your story and seeing the thread that's been there all along. That's how you understand the strength you've built, the skills you already have and what your next step looks like.</p>
